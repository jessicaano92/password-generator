# Password-Generator

# Description 

This password generator allows for a random password to be generated with a character length between 8 and 128 characters. The password must be more than 8 and less than 129 in order to generate. It prompts if the user would like to include random capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The user is able to cancel their way through if they do not choose to have any of the said characters but they will be prompted to choose at least one to be included. From there, they can choose what characters they want to include and once prompted, the password generator will produce a random password with whatever the user decided.

I built this project to not only try and understand code but how it functions and why. When a problem occurred, I learned to go back and debug and try to fix the issue. I struggled with this assignment because there was a lot to it. I'm slowly learning and it is tough to be honest. Coding is very challenging for me but I'm learning a lot everyday.
