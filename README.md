# Password-Generator

# Description 

This password generator allows for a random password to be generated with a character length between 8 and 128 characters. The password must be more than 8 and less than 129 in order to generate. It prompts if the user would like to include random capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The user is able to cancel their way through if they do not choose to have any of the said characters but they will be prompted to choose at least one to be included.
